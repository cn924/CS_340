**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**   
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.  
  
Python Code can get out of hand in a hurry. You can make sure you follow basic principles. Commnet your code appropriately, space properly  
into readable sections. Use apllicable and common sense for naming classes variables, etc.    


**What were the advantages of working in this way?**  

Using the MVC framework. is always nice. Becasue it is chunkified. All parts do distinct duties.

Anytime we need to import a databse that needed to manipulated in a similar manner we could use the CRUD module.

This is the first time I had used Linux and the first for MongoDB.


**What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**  

This is very adaptable you can take a mySQL database, export it locally as a json or csv and use it in MongoDB.
So you can take all the advatages that MongoDB offers. Seecurity is always heralded as a con for MongoDB, but it is   
improving all the time
 
**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**
