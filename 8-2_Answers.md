**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**   
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.  
  
Python Code can get out of hand in a hurry. You can make sure you follow basic principles. Commnet your code appropriately, space properly  
into readable sections. Use apllicable and common sense for naming classes variables, etc.    


**What were the advantages of working in this way?**  

Using the MVC framework. is always nice. Becasue it is chunkified. All parts do distinct duties.

**How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**  

Anytime we need to import a databse that needed to manipulated in a similar manner we could use the CRUD module.


**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
 Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
 
 I look over the requirements carefully and envision myself as the user. From that perspective and   
 desgning with the user in mind, I feel that I will accomplish a greater success in any project.
 
 
 
**How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?** 

This is the first time I had used Linux and the first for MongoDB.


**What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**  

This is very adaptable you can take a mySQL database, export it locally as a json or csv and use it in MongoDB.
So you can take all the advatages that MongoDB offers. Seecurity is always heralded as a con for MongoDB, but it is   
improving all the time
 
**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**  

The is a very open ended question. I view it as serving the user. I attempt to put my self in the users place.
So that I can display data so that they can use it in a useful way. If it is decision making, purchasing ,  
analyzing, manufacturing, or recording for later use. the computer scientist can write programs to help in a variety of ways.


**How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**  

Anytime there is data that needs to be sorted and viewed in a beautiful graphical manner. Whether it be pie charts, bar charts.  
Gps coordinates this project could be easily adapted.
